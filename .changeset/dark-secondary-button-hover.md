Correct the standard Button's Secondary and Outline treatments to match the published Figma component. Dark Secondary hover uses a `#A8939F` background, `#17101A` foreground, and the unchanged `#3D3039` border. Dark Outline uses `#E599B1` for its default/focus/hover border, `#F9E6EC` for its hover background, and `#980030` for its hover foreground. Preserve Ghost's existing `#2D1A26` hover surface through its own component primitive.
