Fix `Button`'s `secondary` variant (it rendered transparent at rest instead of Figma's filled `brand.subtle` background, and used the lighter `brand.border` token instead of `brand.border-strong`) and add the previously-missing `outline` variant, across React, Web Components, and Angular. Both variants share identical border/text colors and an identical solid-fill `active` state via a new `brand.solid-active` token (`@lumen/tokens`); the only difference between them is rest/hover fill. `status` (success/warning/error) is not yet re-verified for `outline`.
